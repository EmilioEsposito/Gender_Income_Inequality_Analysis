# Gender_Income_Inequality_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze the data set from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997 cohort) in order to determine if there is a signifcant difference in income between men and women. We will also determine if any discrepancy in income varies based on other factors in the data (e.g., education, profession, criminal history, marriage status, etc.).
